In the normal state, set operations are processed without any special rules.  In the transaction state, value assignments for parameter objects shall be buffered until the verify state performs a consistency check.  When the consistency check completes, the command responder automatically transitions to the done state where a normal or transaction command may be issued. The normal state is the default state of this object upon initialization.<Format>All writable objects shall be treated as control objects unless otherwise specified (e.g., within a MIB or device-type standard). This object is a control object.Implementations shall not change the designation (e.g., control, parameter, or transaction) of any writable object type from that assigned in the standards to which it claims conformance. The following rules are applied during the processing of SetRequest-PDUs as defined in RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5:NORMAL: When this object is in the 'normal' state:1. An attempt to set a transaction object shall cause Step 9 of RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5 to fail, thereby resulting in a 'notWritable' error. 2. An attempt to set this object to any value other than 'transaction' shall cause Step 10 of RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5 to fail, thereby resulting in an 'inconsistentValue' error.3. When setting this object to 'transition', the second phase of the set operation shall include the command responder copying all the parameter objects currently stored in the device into a buffer. A failure of this copy operation shall result in a failure in the second phase of the set operation and thereby result in a 'commitFailed' error and this object remaining in the 'normal' state.TRANSACTION: When this object is in the 'transaction' state:1. An attempt to set a parameter object using a securityName other than the securityName that was used to start this transaction session shall cause Step 9 of RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5 to fail, thereby resulting in a 'notWritable' error.2. An attempt to set this object using a securityName other than the securityName that was used to start this transaction session shall cause Step 9 of RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5 to fail, thereby resulting in a 'notWritable' error.3. An attempt to set this object to any value other than 'normal' or 'verify' shall cause Step 10 of RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5 to fail, thereby resulting in an 'inconsistentValue' error.4. Within the second phase of the set operation, the command responder shall buffer the creation of and assignments to parameter objects rather than immediately implementing them.5. Within the second phase of the set operation to set this object to 'normal', the agent shall discard all data in the transaction session buffer.NOTE: Control and status objects are processed normally given the above constraints. For example, another securityName can be used to set a control object without error. However, if that request also includes a parameter object, an 'inconsistentValue' error will be generated and neither the control object nor the parameter object will be altered. If the securityName used to initiate the transaction session is used to request setting both a control and a parameter object in a single request, the control object is immediately implemented while the parameter object request is buffered. GetRequest-PDUs are not affected by transaction sessions; they return the values currently implemented while ignoring any buffered values.VERIFY: Upon entry into the verify state, the command responder shall initiate the consistency check process. When this object is in the 'verify' state:1. An attempt to set a parameter object using a securityName other than the securityName that was used to start this transaction session shall cause Step 9 of RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5 to fail, thereby resulting in a 'notWritable' error.2. An attempt to set this object using a securityName other than the securityName that was used to start this transaction session shall cause Step 9 of RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5 to fail, thereby resulting in a 'notWritable' error.3. An attempt to set a parameter object shall cause Step 10 of RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5 to fail, thereby resulting in an 'inconsistentValue' error.4. An attempt to set this object to any value shall cause Step 10 of RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5 to fail, thereby resulting in an 'inconsistentValue' error.When consistency checks are complete the device shall update the values of dbVerifyStatusV2 and dbVerifyErrorV2 and automatically transition this object to the 'done' state.DONE: When this object is in the 'done' state:1. The value of dbVerifyStatusV2 and dbVerifyErrorV2 shall indicate whether the consistency checks found any errors.  2. An attempt to set a parameter object using a securityName other than the securityName that was used to start this transaction session shall cause Step 9 of RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5 to fail, thereby resulting in a 'notWritable' error.3. An attempt to set this object using a securityName other than the securityName that was used to start this transaction session shall cause Step 9 of RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5 to fail, thereby resulting in a 'notWritable' error.4. An attempt to set a parameter object shall cause Step 10 of RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5 to fail, thereby resulting in an 'inconsistentValue' error.5. An attempt to set this object to any value other than 'normal' or 'transaction' shall cause Step 10 of RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5 to fail, thereby resulting in an 'inconsistentValue' error.6. An attempt to set this object to any value when this object is in the process of implementing the buffer while shifting from the 'done' state to the 'normal' state shall cause Step 10 of RFC 3416 Clause 4.2.5 to fail, thereby resulting in an 'inconsistentValue' error. 7. An attempt to set this object to a value of 'transaction' shall cause the command responder to re-enter the 'transaction' state without affecting the contents of the buffer.8. An attempt to set this object to a value of 'normal' when dbVerifyStatusV2 has a value of 'doneWithNoError' shall result in the second phase of the set operation including the assignment of all the buffered data to the device's parameter objects. Any failure in the assignment process shall result in a failure in the second phase of the set operation and thereby result in the Response-PDU indicating either a 'commitFailed' or 'undoFailed' error, as appropriate, and this object remaining in the 'done' state. The values of dbVerifyStatusV2 and dbVerifyErrorV2 shall be updated at the end of the operation as appropriate. 9. An attempt to set this object to a value of 'normal' when dbVerifyStatusV2 has a value other than 'doneWithNoError' shall result in the transaction buffer being discarded during the second phase of the set operation.UsageConsistency checks are intended to analyze parameter objects 'in context' by treating them as an interrelated whole rather than separate non-related data items. Other standards (e.g., device-type standards) should define the minimum consistency check rules to be implemented for their context. Implementations may include additional, custom consistency checks beyond those standardized. NOTE: Other requests (e.g., GetRequest-PDUs and SetRequests containing only control objects) can be processed as normal regardless of the state of this object.<Object Identifier> 1.3.6.1.4.1.1206.4.2.6.9.1.1"DEFVAL	{normal}::= { dbMgmtV2 1 }-- 3.3.2 Database StatusdbMgmtV2Status   OBJECT-TYPESYNTAX	INTEGER {	normal (1),					transaction (2),                         verifying (3),					doneWithNoError (4),					doneWithError (5),                        commitFailed (6),                        undoFailed (7) }MAX-ACCESS	read-onlySTATUS	currentDESCRIPTION "<Definition> This object indicates the status of the consistency checking associated with the dbCreateTransactionV2 object. <Format> When dbCreateTransactionV2 is in the 'normal' or 'transaction' state, this object shall indicate the respective value.

The transaction mode changes the behavior of the agent to force buffering of parameter objects until all related parameter objects have been modified.  In the normal mode, SET operations to any parameter object shall either be stored in a device's database immediately with no regard to whether other changes will be made or be rejected (as defined in the device-specific Information Profile).  In the transaction mode, SET operations to any parameter object shall be buffered until a verify state performs a consistency check.  When the consistency check completes, the device automatically transitions to the done state where a normal or transaction command may be issued.  A parameter object is a user-provided piece of setup information (or it may be defined in an information profile) that is necessary for the proper operation of a device.  It is static in nature in that the agent would never change it without direction from the management station.  For example, an object that defines a default mode of operation would be a parameter object.  An object that indicates the current state of the device would not be a parameter object.      <Format>The states and commands are defined as:NORMAL:  SET operations behave as normal SETs and shall have an immediate effect on the value of any parameter objects used by the device if none of the objects contained in the operation require the use of the transaction mode (as defined in the device-specific Information Profile).  A SET operation containing any transaction object (i.e., a parameter object that requires the use of transaction mode) shall result in a genErr.  This is the default state of this object.  The only command that may be written to dbCreateTransaction while in this state is TRANSACTION.  Any other values written to this object in this state shall result in an error response of 'badValue'.TRANSACTION: A SET operation of one or more parameter objects that use the same community name as used in the request for the TRANSACTION state are buffered by the agent device for later consistency checks and a normal response is returned.  A SET operation of one or more parameter objects using different community names shall result in a genErr with the index set to zero.  A SET operation without a community name field (e.g., an STMP operation) shall be buffered by the agent device for later consistency checks and a normal response is returned.  Standard SYNTAX checking shall take place at the time of the SET operation.  A transaction may consist of multiple SET operations over multiple frames.  A SET operation for one or more non-parameter objects shall be processed as normal even if it uses another community name, except for this (i.e., the dbCreateTransaction) object.  A SET operation containing both parameter and non-parameter objects shall be processed in full according to these two rules.  Thus, if it contains the same community name as used in the request for the TRANSACTION state, the non-parameter objects shall be stored immediately while the parameter objects shall be buffered.  If it uses a different community name, the entire request will be rejected and a genErr with an index of zero shall be returned.GET operations on any object shall return the values of the data stored in the controller and shall ignore any values contained in the buffer.  Any valid community name may read this (dbCreateTransaction) object when in this state, but only the community name used to command the object to the transaction mode and the administrator community name can set this object. A set from any other community name shall result in a genErr with an index of zero. The only commands that can be written to dbCreateTransaction while in this state are VERIFY and NORMAL.  A VERIFY command will change the state to VERIFY.  If a NORMAL command is received, all buffered data is discarded and the state is returned to NORMAL.  Any other values written to this object when in this state shall result in an error response of 'badValue'.VERIFY: Specific parameter objects are checked for consistency.  When consistency checks are complete the device will automatically advance to the DONE state.The state of dbCreateTransaction cannot be changed when in the VERIFY state.  Any values written to this object in this state shall result in an error response of 'badValue'.The consistency check analyzes certain critical objects 'in context' and treats them as an interrelated whole rather than separate non-related data items.   The consistency check rules are not defined in NTCIP 1201 v03, since these are device and implementation specific.  Where applicable, the consistency check rules are defined in application specific object definition standards.   A specific implementation may add additional checks beyond those defined in NTCIP standards. A SET operation containing any parameter objects while in the VERIFY state shall result in a genErr with the index set to zero.  DONE:  This state is entered automatically once consistency checks have completed in the VERIFY mode.  The value of dbVerifyStatus and dbVerifyError indicate whether the consistency check found any errors.  A SET operation containing any parameter objects while in the DONE state shall result in a genErr with the index set to zero.  Any valid community name may read this (dbCreateTransaction) object when in this state, but only the community name used to command the object to the transaction mode and the administrator community name can set this object. A set from any other community name shall result in a genErr with an index of zero. The only commands that can be written to dbCreateTransaction while in this state are NORMAL and TRANSACTION.  Any other values written to this object in this state shall result in an error response of 'badValue'.If a NORMAL command is issued and dbVerifyStatus indicates doneWithNoError, the buffered data is transferred to the device memory and the state is returned to NORMAL.  If a NORMAL command is issued and dbVerifyStatus indicates something other than doneWithNoError then the buffered data is discarded and the state is returned to NORMAL.If a TRANSACTION command is issued, regardless of dbVerifyStatus, no action takes place (the buffered data is not changed) and the TRANSACTION state is re-entered.COMMANDED STATE (9)transactionverifynormaldoneCURRENTSTATEnormaltransaction (1)normal (2)normal (2)normal (2)transactiontransaction (2)verify (3)normal (4)transaction (2)verify (7)verify (2)verify(2)verify (2)verify (2)done (8)transaction (5)done(2)normal (6)done (2)Operational procedures and error responses:(1)  Once a copy of all parameter objects is placed in a buffer, the state is changed to transaction and error response indicates noError.

NTCIP 1201 v02 moved the objects to the location      defined by this MIB but retained the same object names.      Experience demonstrated challenges in compiling MIB files with duplicate      object names and as a result NTCIP 1201 v03 changed the names of objects      while retaining the NTCIP 1201 v02 object identifiers.

NTCIP 1203:1997) under the      experimental node. When the objects were moved to NTCIP 1201 v02, a      slightly revised structure was developed under the global node and the      original experimental objects were deprecated. This MIB is provided for      backwards compatibility to support access to the experimental objects      via an SNMPv3 proxy agent.     In the context of implementation that supports these objects, there is      no difference between what appeared in NTCIP 1203:1997 and what appears      here.     The auxiliary I/O management objects listed herein define a      mechanism for the support of unspecified I/O for an NTCIP device.       The agency or device specifications should define the intended operation      of these ports.        NOTE: These objects are still logically located under the      nemaExperimental node and use their originally defined textual names and      OIDs. For the purposes of backward compatibility, the object STATUS has      been changed to deprecated. For those agents that may support these      objects and the new objects under the global node (see Section 2.9), the      object definitions shall be treated as aliases in that a write to an      object in one group acts as write to the corresponding object in the      other group. As aliases, a read of an object in one group also acts as      read of the corresponding object in the other group.     Early NTCIP deployments included the Aux I/O objects defined in NTCIP      1203 v01 located under an experimental node.  These objects were moved      to a permanent node with the release of NTCIP 1201 v02 and given new      names.  This can create confusion and backward compatibility issues.       As noted in the object definition, both sets of objects refer to the      same functions within the device; hence, both sets of objects cause the     same device action or provide the same device status.       Agency specifications which do NOT require support for the Aux I/O      objects under the experimental node should exclude the support      for these experimental objects (which have been deprecated) to ensure      backward compatibility.  Support of the Aux I/O objects under the      permanent node identified in NTCIP 1201 v03 may be optional      or mandatory depending on the agency- or project specification.       Use the PRL to exclude support of NTCIP 1201 v01-defined aux I/O      objects. The relationship between mandatory and optional support of     NTCIP 1201 v01 (experimental) and NTCIP 1201 v02 objects is unique to      the Aux I/O objects.           *** All objects in this MIB have been deprecated. ***     <Object Identifier> 1.3.6.1.4.1.1206.2.2.1     Copyright (C) 2010, 2022 by the American Association of State Highway      and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the Institute of Transportation     Engineers (ITE), and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association     (NEMA).

A GET shall always return zero (0).    <Superseded by> NTCIP1201-RecMechV2.recMechV2RecordingDelete,       recMechV2OwnerClearAllRecordings, & adminRecMechClearAllRecordings    <Object Identifier> 1.3.6.1.4.1.1206.4.1.1.7.9.15"::= { recMech 15 }-- 17.4 COMPLIANCE GROUPS-- 17.4.1 Watch Block GrouprecMechGroupR1 OBJECT-GROUP  OBJECTS { maxRecClasses,            recClassNumber,            recClassLimit,            recClassClearTime,            recClassDescription,            recClassNumRecordings,            recClassRecordingCounter,            maxRecConfigs,            recMinSamplePeriod,            recMaxSamplePeriod,            recSamplePeriodResolution,            recConfigID,            recConfigClass,            recConfigMode,            recConfigCompareValue,            recConfigCompareValue2,            recConfigCompareOID,            recConfigRecordOID,            recConfigTriggerPoint,            recConfigSamplePeriod,            recConfigSampleOID,            recConfigNumEntries,            recConfigAction,            recConfigStatus,            maxRecordings,            recordingClass,            recordingNumber,            recordingID,            recordingConfigID,            recordingTriggerTime,            recordingStatus,            recordingTriggerRecNum,            recordingNumEntries,            maxRecEntries,            recEntryNumber,            recSampleTime,            recValue,            numRecordings,            recClearClasses,            recClearConfigurations,            recClearRecordingData }  STATUS     deprecated  DESCRIPTION    "<Definition> The objects necessary for managing the high-resolution data       recording mechanism.      <Object Identifier> 1.3.6.1.4.1.1206.4.1.1.7.9.127.2.1"  ::= {recMechGroups 1}END -- NTCIP1201-RechMech
